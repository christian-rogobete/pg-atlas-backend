    PG Atlas application settings.

    Required environment variables:
        PG_ATLAS_API_URL: The canonical URL of this API instance. Used as the
            OIDC audience when verifying GitHub OIDC tokens from the SBOM action.
            Must exactly match the ``audience`` value the action was configured with.

    Optional environment variables (required for the database write path, A2+):
        PG_ATLAS_DATABASE_URL: Async SQLAlchemy database URL
            (``postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db``). An empty string disables
            the database session factory; the server will start but any endpoint that
            calls ``get_db_session()`` will raise at runtime.
        PG_ATLAS_ARTIFACT_STORE_PATH: Filesystem path where raw SBOM bytes are written
            (local dev). Defaults to ``./artifact_store`` (relative to the working
            directory). In production, set this to the container-local mount point of
            the Storacha-backed volume.
        PG_ATLAS_LOG_LEVEL: Python log level string (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
            Defaults to INFO.
        PG_ATLAS_JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS: How long to cache GitHub's JWKS response
            in memory. Defaults to 3600 (1 hour). GitHub rotates keys infrequently.
