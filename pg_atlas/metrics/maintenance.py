"""
Maintenance metric: signal payloads and pure per-repo signal computation.

The maintenance metric describes how a repository is kept up: release cadence,
issue and PR responsiveness, backlog health, and activity recency. It is a
profile dimension — per-signal raw values plus percentile ranks over the
eligible population — never a single combined score.

Division of labor:
    - ``pg_atlas.procrastinate.github_maintenance`` collects issue/PR signals
      from the GitHub API into ``Repo.repo_metadata["maintenance_signals"]``
      and persists ``Repo.pushed_at``.
    - This module holds the payload types and the pure signal math, shared by
      the collector, the materializer, and fixture tests.
    - ``pg_atlas.metrics.materialize_maintenance`` computes release cadence
      from stored releases, commit activity from git-log artifacts, ranks all
      scalars, and writes ``Repo.repo_metadata["maintenance_profile"]``.

Four coverage states are kept distinct throughout: a real observed zero is
``ok`` with value ``0``; ``not-applicable`` marks signals that do not apply
(e.g. a declared external issue tracker); ``unavailable`` marks absent data;
``incomplete`` marks capped, stale, or failed collection — its values are
context only and are never percentile-ranked.
