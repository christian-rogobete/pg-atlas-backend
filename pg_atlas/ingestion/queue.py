"""
SBOM submission queue stub for PG Atlas.

In v0 (A3), the queue is a logging stub that records the submission and returns
a structured result. The A8 processing pipeline will replace this stub with a
task dispatch that triggers schema validation, dependency extraction,
repo and edge upserts, and NetworkX graph reload.
