# Implementation Notes

Human + agent co-authored conventions that are good to be aware of.

## A3 Implementation Notes

These conventions emerged during A3 and apply to all future write-path work.

### PURL canonical IDs

- GitHub repos use `pkg:github/owner/repo` (from the OIDC `repository` claim, or extracted from
  SPDX `documentNamespace`).
- Package dependencies use the PURL from `package.external_references[].locator` where
  `reference_type` contains `"purl"`, with the version suffix stripped
  (`pkg:cargo/foo@1.2.3` → `pkg:cargo/foo`). Falls back to `package.name.lower()`.
- The helper functions live in `pg_atlas/ingestion/persist.py`:
  `canonical_id_for_github_repo()` and `canonical_id_for_spdx_package()`.

### JTI upsert safety

- `upsert_external_repo()` (in `vertex_ops.py`) checks the `RepoVertex` base table first. If the
  canonical_id belongs to a `Repo`, it **raises `ValueError`** (programming error — bootstrap flow
  never hits this). If the canonical_id belongs to an `ExternalRepo`, it updates and returns it.
  Only inserts if no base row exists.
- SBOM ingestion (`persist.py`) catches `ValueError` from `upsert_external_repo()` and falls back
  to `get_vertex()` — a dependency in the SBOM can legitimately match an existing `Repo`.

### `maybe_db_session` dependency

- Declared in `pg_atlas/db_models/session.py`.
- Yields `None` when `settings.DATABASE_URL` is empty (no DB configured).
- Yields a live `AsyncSession` otherwise.
- Test fixtures must override this dependency in `app.dependency_overrides` to yield `None`
  (using `_no_db_session` async generator) to prevent event-loop binding issues.

### Test isolation for DB integration tests

- Each test generates a unique `repository` claim via `_unique_claims()` with a `uuid4().hex[:8]`
  suffix so tests sharing SBOM fixture content don't conflict on `(content_hash, repository_claim)`.
- Exception: `test_handle_sbom_submission_github_dep_graph` uses the exact repo name from the SPDX
  fixture to trigger the self-reference check in `_upsert_external_repo()`.

## A2 Implementation Notes

These conventions emerged during A2 and apply to all future work.

### postgres:18 quirks

- Role names starting with `pg_` are disallowed as superuser names. Use `atlas` (not `pg_atlas`).
- Data directory volume mount is `/var/lib/postgresql` (not `.../data`) — PG18 layout change.
- `docker-compose.yml` uses `POSTGRES_USER: atlas`, `POSTGRES_DB: pg_atlas`.
- Local `DATABASE_URL`: `postgresql://atlas:changeme@localhost:5432/pg_atlas`.

### SQLAlchemy JTI with MappedAsDataclass

- `polymorphic_identity` must be the **enum member** (e.g. `NodeType.repo`), not the string value.
  The `Enum(NodeType)` column type causes SQLAlchemy to return enum members on SELECT, and the
  polymorphic map must match.
- `init=False` must be declared at the **attribute level** (`id: Mapped[intpk] = mapped_column(init=False)`),
  not inside an `Annotated` alias — SADeprecationWarning otherwise.
- `__mapper_args__` must not have a type annotation — SQLAlchemy stubs type it as instance var,
  `ClassVar` annotation causes mypy `[misc]` errors.
- When two relationships both write to the same FK column, add `overlaps="<other_rel_name>"` to
  silence the SQLAlchemy warning.
- **`metadata` is reserved** by `DeclarativeBase`. Use `project_metadata` / `repo_metadata` as the
  Python attribute name with `mapped_column("metadata", ...)` to keep the DB column named `metadata`.
- **MappedAsDataclass field ordering**: non-default fields must come before fields with `default=`
  or `default_factory=`. When making a nullable column required, verify it doesn't break dataclass
  ordering in the same or sub-class. Fix by reordering fields or adding `default=None` explicitly.

### Enum values vs names

- All PostgreSQL ENUM columns use `values_callable=enum_values` (from `base.py`) so Postgres stores
  the Python `.value` (e.g. `"in-dev"`) not the Python name (e.g. `"in_dev"`). This keeps DB data
  readable and resilient to Python identifier renaming.
- The shared helper is `pg_atlas.db_models.base.enum_values`; do not write per-column lambdas.

### Async test fixtures with asyncpg

- pytest-asyncio (`asyncio_mode = "auto"`) creates a new event loop **per test function** by default.
  asyncpg connections are bound to a specific event loop. Therefore, the `db_session` fixture must
  create a **fresh engine with `NullPool`** per test and dispose it afterward. Never use a pooled
  singleton engine across tests.

### Alembic + custom TypeDecorators

- Alembic autogenerate renders custom TypeDecorators using their module-qualified repr, which creates
  unimportable references in migration files. Fix: add a `render_item` hook to `migrations/env.py`
  that catches `isinstance(obj, HexBinary)` and returns `f"sa.LargeBinary(length={obj.impl.length})"`.
- The `render_item` signature must be `(str, Any, AutogenContext) -> str | Literal[False]`;
  import `AutogenContext` from `alembic.autogenerate.api`.
- PostgreSQL enum types created implicitly with tables are **not** dropped by `op.drop_table()` in
  downgrade functions. Add explicit `op.execute("DROP TYPE IF EXISTS <name>")` calls at the end of
  every `downgrade()` that creates enum columns.

### db_models package layout

```txt
pg_atlas/db_models/
    __init__.py          # re-exports all model classes; single import registers all on PgBase.metadata
    base.py              # PgBase, HexBinary, enum_values, all enums, intpk/canonical_id/content_hash
    project.py           # Project (standalone)
    repo_vertex.py       # RepoVertex (JTI base), Repo, ExternalRepo
    contributor.py       # Contributor (standalone)
    depends_on.py        # DependsOn edge
    contributed_to.py    # ContributedTo edge
    sbom_submission.py   # SbomSubmission audit table
    session.py           # async session manager; uses a lazy singleton factory; tests must bypass it with `NullPool`.
```

## A5 Implementation Notes

These conventions emerged during A5 implementation and apply to all future task/crawl work.

### Upsert patterns

- `upserts.py` helpers each open their own session via `get_session_factory()` from
  `pg_atlas.db_models.session` — the factory is imported locally inside functions to avoid
  event-loop binding issues.
- `_promote_external_to_repo()` does a 3-step Core operation: delete ExternalRepo child → update
  discriminator on `repo_vertices` → insert Repo child row. Uses `metadata` (column name) not
  `repo_metadata` (Python attribute name) for the Core insert.
- `absorb_external_repo()` merges an ExternalRepo into an existing Repo by re-pointing all
  DependsOn edges and deleting the ExternalRepo vertex. Uses SQLAlchemy Core for edge manipulation
  to handle composite-PK conflict detection.
- `find_repo_by_release_purl()` uses JSONB containment (`@>`) on `repos.releases` to look up
  a Repo by a package PURL from its releases list. GIN index `ix_repos_releases_gin` makes this fast.

### Vertex model invariants

- **Repo.canonical_id** = always `pkg:github/owner/repo`; ExternalRepo.canonical_id = always
  `pkg:{ecosystem}/name`. The GitHub dependents crawler (`crawlers/github_dependents.py`) does not
  touch this model: it stores what it sees in `github_dependents_crawl_runs` /
  `github_dependent_observations` (typed GitHub canonical ids, optional resolved link to a tracked
  Repo) and creates no vertices and no DependsOn edges.
- Crawlers create ExternalRepo when no Project association is known; Repo only through project link.
- `is_project_repo()` was removed — deps.dev requirements use ecosystem PURLs, never `pkg:github/`.
  Use `find_repo_by_release_purl()` to check if a package PURL maps to an existing Repo.

### deps.dev channel reuse

- `depsdev_session()` yields a reusable `InsightsStub` backed by a single TLS channel. All 4 public
  functions (`get_package`, `get_requirements`, `get_project_batch`, `get_project_package_versions`)
  accept an optional `stub` keyword argument for channel reuse. Without it, an ephemeral channel
  is created per call (backwards compatible).

### Task testing patterns

- Procrastinate tasks are callable: `await task(...)` executes the underlying function.
- To mock session factory inside task functions, patch at the **import site**:
  `pg_atlas.procrastinate.tasks.get_session_factory` (not the source module
  `pg_atlas.db_models.session.get_session_factory`).
- For recursive `defer_async` calls, use `patch.object(task, "configure", ...)` to intercept
  the Procrastinate task object's method.
- Tests that exit before DB access (e.g., `DepsDevError`) don't need the session factory mock.

### pyproject.toml tooling config

- `ruff exclude`: `pg_atlas/deps_dev/lib` (generated code).
- `ruff per-file-ignores`: `E501` for Procrastinate migration files (embedded SQL).
- `mypy exclude`: `pg_atlas/deps_dev/lib` (generated code).
- `types-PyYAML` added to dev deps for type stubs.

## A8 Implementation Notes

These conventions emerged during A8 implementation (PR #26) and apply to artifact storage and background processing.

### Artifact Storage (Filebase)

- Durable artifact storage uses Filebase's S3-compatible API.
- The `ARTIFACT_S3_ENDPOINT` requires `ARTIFACT_S3_BUCKET`, `FILEBASE_ACCESS_KEY`, and `FILEBASE_SECRET_KEY`. Pydantic models validate this implicitly.
- Uploads happen using `boto3` (via `aiobotocore`) via S3 APIs `put_object`.
- The durable unique ID (CID) of an artifact is returned in the `x-amz-meta-cid` header from both `put_object` and `head_object`.
- Retrieval path differs from S3: reading Filebase objects via standard S3 API `get_object` by CID returns `NoSuchKey`. Instead, all reads (both worker processing and public API) use the IPFS gateway endpoint `https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/<cid>`.
- The `artifact_path` stored in the DB is always the CID string itself.

### Parser/latency optimization (A8 follow-up)

- `pg_atlas/ingestion/spdx.py` no longer uses stdlib `json` or Pydantic for SBOM decode/hash extraction.
- Raw SPDX bytes are decoded exactly once in `parse_and_validate_spdx()` using `msgspec` (`msgspec.json.Decoder`).
- SPDX validation uses `spdx_tools.spdx.parser.jsonlikedict.JsonLikeDictParser` directly (no temp files).
- `ParsedSbom` now carries:
  - `document`
  - `package_count`
  - `unwrapped_bytes` (canonical SPDX JSON with no GitHub `{"sbom": ...}` envelope)
  - `semantic_hash`
- `compute_sbom_semantic_hash(raw)` now delegates to `parse_and_validate_spdx(raw)` and falls back to raw SHA-256 when parsing fails.

### Artifact write format

- New ingested artifacts are persisted as **unwrapped SPDX JSON** bytes (inner document only).
- Legacy stored enveloped artifacts remain supported: worker parsing still accepts `{"sbom": ...}` payloads.
- On validation failure where envelope decoding succeeds, failed-submission artifacts are still stored in unwrapped form for consistency.

## A7 Implementation Notes

These conventions emerged during A7 completion and apply to gitlog parsing, queue orchestration, and audit visibility.

### Gitlog queue orchestration

- Shared orchestration lives in `pg_atlas/gitlog/runtime.py`; both CLI and Procrastinate task entrypoints delegate there.
- Procrastinate integration uses a dedicated `gitlog` queue task (`process_gitlog_batch`) that accepts repository ID batches (`list[int]`), matching the runtime entrypoint.
- Batch seeding is DB-driven (`seed_gitlog.py`) and uses `PG_ATLAS_GITLOG_BATCH_SIZE` for deterministic batch fan-out.

### Attempt auditing and artifact replacement

- Every gitlog parse attempt persists a `GitLogArtifact` row (status, warning/error detail, commit/contributor counts, artifact path).
- Successful attempts null out historical `artifact_path` pointers for the same repo to keep a single active path while preserving historical rows.
- Terminal clone/fetch failures are accumulated and private-marked in one post-run DB update pass.

### API read surface

- Gitlog audit visibility is exposed via `/gitlog/artifacts` list and `/gitlog/artifacts/{id}` detail.
- Repo-level contributor access now has a direct endpoint `/repos/{canonical_id}/contributors`.

## A9 / PR #56 Interactive Replay Notes

These conventions emerged while validating SBOM queue behavior locally with real artifacts and apply to future ingestion-performance investigations.

### Local replay procedure for SBOM queue (interactive)

- Start by inspecting candidate submissions through SQLAlchemy (equivalent to `psql -P pager=off`):
  `SELECT id, repository_claim, status, submitted_at, processed_at FROM sbom_submissions WHERE id >= 187 ORDER BY id`.
- Always set `PG_ATLAS_IPFS_GATEWAY_URL` in the shell for replay runs (do not store in tracked files); ask the user to provide its value through your input tool.
- Build a replay workload from known `processed` and `failed` rows by cloning their `(repository_claim, actor_claim, sbom_content_hash, artifact_path)` into new `pending` rows.
- Enqueue each clone using `defer_sbom_processing(submission_id, repository_claim=...)`.
- Run the worker with the same settings as CI queue jobs from `sbom-queue.yml`.
- Measure outcomes from both DB and logs:
  - DB: status transitions for cloned IDs (`processed` / `failed` / still `pending`).
  - Logs: deadlock traces (`DeadlockDetectedError`), per-job durations, and total elapsed worker runtime.

### SBOM flattening impact measurement method

- For each replay candidate, compare:
  - **Flat model**: unique non-self package canonical IDs (`repo -> dep` only).
  - **Structured model**: root targets plus nested SPDX-derived edges (`root -> dep`, `dep -> dep`).
- Use real artifacts from `sbom_submissions.id >= 187` and compute counts from parsed SPDX relationships.
- Observed examples (real submissions):
  - `id=191` (`theahaco/scaffold-stellar`): flat root edges `1903` vs structured root `593` + nested `3055`.
  - `id=188` (`theahaco/scaffold-stellar-frontend`): flat root `1080` vs structured root `296` + nested `1794`.
  - `id=190` (`theahaco/registry-ui`): flat root `638` vs structured root `137` + nested `1335`.
- Interpretation: removing flattening sharply reduces root fan-out inflation while preserving transitive topology as nested edges.

### Concurrency/locking findings from local replay

- Baseline (pre-optimization): cloned submissions `854-860` produced multiple deadlocks under `--concurrency=4` and left several replay rows failed.
- Nested edge optimization alone (bulk `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT` for nested `DependsOn`) reduced query count but did not remove deadlocks by itself.
- Additional deterministic+deduplicated dependency vertex upsert ordering in `persist.py` materially improved behavior:
  - clean replay set `893-899` processed targeted queued rows without deadlocks;
  - final log showed `elapsed_s=19.17` for two drain rounds including background failed-artifact retries.
- Practical guidance: when investigating SBOM worker concurrency, optimize both nested edge writes and external-repo upsert ordering; the latter can dominate deadlock behavior.

## A10 Implementation Notes

These conventions emerged during A10 adoption-signal wiring and apply to future crawler/metric work.

### System taxonomy separation

- `package-deps` (deps.dev) and `registry-crawl` (direct ecosystem registries) are intentionally separate paths.
- deps.dev scope is fixed to seven systems (`PYPI`, `NPM`, `CARGO`, `MAVEN`, `GO`, `RUBYGEMS`, `NUGET`) and should not be extended in A10 code.
- Direct registry crawling currently supports `DART` (pub.dev), `COMPOSER` (Packagist), `NPM`,
  `CARGO`, and `PYPI` via `pg_atlas.crawlers.factory`.

### Registry-specific A10 conventions

- NPM and PyPI intentionally leave dependents empty for now; keep the explicit TODO in the
  crawler implementation until a practical first-party API exists.
- Cargo dependents paginate with the same 50-page / 500-item ceiling used for Packagist
  validation runs.
- PyPI download totals come from the PyPIStats `recent` endpoint with
  `period=month&mirrors=true`; the `pypistats` package is still the source of truth for endpoint
  semantics, but the crawler calls the endpoint through `_request_with_retry()` because the package
  wrapper does not expose the `mirrors` argument on `recent()`.

### Msgspec payload decoding pattern

- Registry crawler JSON responses are decoded immediately from response bytes using
  `msgspec.json.decode(response.content, type=<TypedPayloadStruct>)`.
- Each endpoint has a dedicated private typed payload model (`msgspec.Struct`) with
  `forbid_unknown_fields=False` and defaults for optional fields.
- Decoding is payload-level best effort: catch `msgspec.ValidationError`, log a warning, and
  continue with a default payload object instead of raising.
- Numeric normalization happens right after decode (for example `int | float | None` to `int | None`),
  so downstream crawler logic consumes normalized ints and avoids ad-hoc coercion.
- Runtime parsing code should read typed model attributes directly; avoid `dict[str, Any]`/
  `list[object]` JSON walk patterns and avoid `typing.cast`.

### Monorepo adoption downloads map-reduce

- Registry crawls now persist per-package download snapshots under
  `Repo.repo_metadata["adoption_downloads_by_purl"]`.
- Map phase: each registry package crawl updates only its own PURL key.
- Reduce phase: adoption materialization sums per-PURL values and writes the total back to `Repo.adoption_downloads` before percentile ranking.

### Bootstrap queue topology

- `bootstrap.yml` now runs four jobs:
  - `crawl` (`opengrants` queue)
  - `deps-dev` (`package-deps` queue)
  - `registries` (`registry-crawl` queue)
  - `metrics` (criticality + adoption materialization)
- `deps-dev` and `registries` run in parallel after `crawl` completes; `metrics` depends on both.

### Unsupported ecosystem observability

- `crawl_github_repo` logs unsupported registry systems using a structured line:
  `registry-crawl unsupported ecosystem: system=<SYSTEM> purls=<SPACE_SEPARATED_PURLS>`
- `.github/scripts/parse-bootstrap-log.py` groups these by ecosystem and emits:
  - `unsupported_ecosystem_group_count`
  - `unsupported_ecosystem_purl_count`
  - `unsupported_ecosystems` (grouped full PURL list lines)
